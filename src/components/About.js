                  <h2>About the <i>Chronicle</i></h2>
                  <p>The <i>Chronicle</i> of Matthew of Edessa was written in the first half of the twelfth century, probably in stages between the years 1102 and 1131. Matthew was an Armenian priest resident in, and probably native to, Edessa; he wrote in the vernacular version of the language with which he was familiar. His history covers the history of the Armenian principalities as well as Byzantium and the emirates of the Near East between the years 952 and 1129. The text was extended by an author himself only as ‘the humble priest Grigor’, a resident of the nearby town of Kesun, to cover the year 1136 to 1162.</p>
                  <p>The <i>Chronicle</i> survives in at least 35 more or less complete manuscripts held in libraries throughout Europe and the Near East. Although the text was known to have been read by others within a century of its completion—Smbat, the brother of king Hetʿum of Cilicia in the thirteenth century, relied almost entirely upon Matthew’s text for the relevant portion of his own history—the surviving manuscripts all date from 1590 or later, and the two oldest manuscripts represent two distinct recensions. Roughly half of the manuscripts can be dated to the seventeenth century. This was the period of a great ‘rescue’ of Armenian literature—a concerted effort to copy and preserve the texts that had survived the ravages of war and invasion between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. </p>
                  <p>The first publication of the <i>Chronicle</i> was the French translation published by Edouard Dulaurier in 1858, which was made from a manuscript prepared by the Mekhitarist Fathers of Venice, on the basis of the four copies held in that library. This includes the oldest extant copy of the text. The <em>editio princeps</em> was published in Jerusalem in 1869, on the basis of two manuscripts held in the library there and with reference to the translation of Dulaurier; this was superseded by the edition published in 1898 in Vałaršapat, Armenia.</p>
                  <p>The Vałaršapat edition took as its base a manuscript copied in 1689 at Amrdolu monastery in Bitlis, under the patronage of Vardan Bałišecʿi. This was regarded by the editors as the best surviving text, due partially to the claims of its provenance made in the colophon and partially to the presence of two passages of text that are missing in all other versions. The editors also noted selected variants from five other manuscripts now held at the Matenadaran, as well as from the <em>editio princeps</em>. All six of these manuscripts are included in the present edition.</p>

                  <p>This edition has its beginnings in the D.Phil. thesis of Tara L. Andrews, completed at the University of Oxford in 2009. 
                        The groundwork for the present edition has been laid thanks to the generous support of the Swiss National Science Foundation, 
                        through the project <a href="http://p3.snf.ch/project-159433">The Chronicle of Matthew of Edessa Online</a>, 
                        which ran from 2015 to 2019.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tara L. Andrews</strong> has been Professor for Digital Humanities at the University of Vienna since 2016. 
                        She did her B.Sc. in Humanities and Engineering at MIT (1995–1999), followed by an M.Phil. (2003–2005) and D.Phil. (2006–2009) at the University of Oxford. She began to study aspects of the <i>Chronicle</i> while preparing her M.Phil. thesis; this together with her doctoral work resulted in a 2016 monograph published by Brill. Tara's research interests include the history and historiography 
                        of the Christian Near East in the tenth to twelfth centuries, the application of computational and 
                        statistical methods for reconstruction of the copying history of ancient and medieval manuscripts (stemmatology), 
                        and reflection on the implications of employing digital media and computational methods in humanities contexts, all of 
                        which have figured in production of the present edition.</p>

                <p>The <i>Chronicle</i> (Ժամանակագրութիւն) of Mattʿēos Uṙhayecʿi, known to most Western historians as Matthew of Edessa, was completed sometime before 1137 and covers events between the Armenian years 401 and 577 (April 952–February 1129). Matthew was a monk, an elder (erecʿ) in a monastery in Edessa, born perhaps in the third quarter of the eleventh century. His work was continued by Grigor, a priest living in the nearby town of Kesun, who provides information about events in the Armenian years 585–611 (February 1136–February 1163) as well. The Chronicle of Uṙhayecʿi is traditionally divided into three books covering respectively the Armenian years 401-500, 500–550, and 550–577, plus the continuation of Grigor.</p>
